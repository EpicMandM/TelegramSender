# Telegram Sender

This is a .NET class library that provides a simple API for sending messages via Telegram. The library uses the TLSharp library to interact with the Telegram API.

## Getting Started

To use this library in your .NET project, you will need to add a reference to the `TelegramSender` project and include the following using statement in your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using TL;
using WTelegram;
```

Once you have done this, you can call the `SendMessageAsync` method in the `Telegram` class to send a message to a phone number. The method takes two parameters: the phone number and the message to send.
